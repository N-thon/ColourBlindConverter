# ColourBlindConverter
converts webcam feed to mimic colourblindness using Numpy and OpenCV 

requirements - numpy, imutils, opencv 

I am, like 5% of the male population (and 0.5% of the female population), red-green colourblind. 
More specificaly, i suffer from Deuteranomaly which means that the cones in my eyes that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light have their peak shifted further towards the red sensitive cones.
When i first found out that i was colourblind, i was hartbroken as it prevented me from persuing my life long ambition of becoming a train driver!
Now my interests have shifted to understanding and percieving the world around us.
My equal interest in computing has tied in nicely as i have begun to experimented with computer vision in recent years. 
this project aims to make it easier for others to understand my visual imparement by showing them in real-time what the world around us looks like to me.
The bulk of the image manipulation comes from another project on github by tsarjak and can be found here:
